# GonioApp 2.0

My thesis, what I've written for my school ([Óbuda University Kandó Kálmán Facility of Electrical Engineering](http://kvk.uni-obuda.hu)). The university got a goniophotometer, which was upgraded at winter of 2019. After the upgrading, the previous software was unable to control it, so I got the task to make it work.
If you want to know more about that device, take a look at the Microelectronics and Technology Institute's webpage [here](http://mti.kvk.uni-obuda.hu).
